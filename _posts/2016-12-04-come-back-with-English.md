It has been a really long long time since I wrote a blog last time. I know, it's probably because of my laziness. 
But plagiarism by some domestic websites did blow off some of my motivation to write.These days, I figure out 
I better promote myself and continue blogging, otherwise I'd be out of date.

So I made a decision, from now on, I shall write blog in English. On one hand, I kind of love English. 
On the other hand, I think that should stop some websites from plagiarizing my blog.

Hope I can stick on, make it a habit. Good luck to me!
